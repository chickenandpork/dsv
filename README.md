DataStore Validation: for a related project, do you have a datastore we can use?

The structure of this project needs ot remain fairly constant -- it's a part of a larger thing.  I hope with additions to the `gorm` directory, and cheanges to existing `proto` files, we can confirm functionality on more datastore backends such as MongoDB, Sqlite, whatever we can use with some performance.
